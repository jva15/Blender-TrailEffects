# WIP TrailEffects
**#WIP**  
WOOPS! accidentaly pressed enter and commited prematurely.
Won't be too long before it's alpha though, until then help your self to some code bits.

This plugin for Blender generates an armature based trail. Ideal for sword trails specifically. 
because it creates an armature, it should be compatible with game engines like Unreal. 

based on a method shared by Pierrick Picaut on youtube.

please understand that this is not ready and it's littered with testing code.
but when it's done, it'll be as easy as copy and pasting
