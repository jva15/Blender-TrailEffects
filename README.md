# TrailEffects 
This plugin for Blender generates an armature based trail. Ideal for sword/mellee trails specifically. 
because it creates an armature, it should be compatible with game engines like Unreal. 
To use:
  1. click the Effects side tab and look for "Trail Tracer"
  2. Switch to pose mode and click the bone you want to trace after.
  3. Select a mode: (Generate is the only one available at the moment)
  4. Once everything is to your liking, click 'Create Trail'.
  5. a trail armature will be generated where you can then tweak it using the bottom left pannel.
You can also change the material if you'd rather use a different one. just keep in mind that the U(x axis) of the default textures are
flipped incase your thinking of using that as a reference or base.
## UPDATE 0.1.1
  1.fixed a bug that caused bones to excessively space out.
  
  2.now framelength pertains to the frame length of the trail instead of per bone.

  3.change fremlength to a float which fixed problems with inaccuracies
  
  4.adding bones distributes across the length like it should now.
  
  5.you can now create trails more intuitively. you can change the bone resolution, framelength, and trailwidth and preview your changes.
  
  6.added a bake mode that uses the current frame as the end frame.
  







there are quite afew kinks and bugs to work out though and ease of use features are currently on the way on a bi-tri daily basis
so stay tuned and be prepared to either wait it out or clone alot.
